Online Inventory Management System

I used to develop this tiny app as my university project. 
I like to learn modern technique, relational database management system, framework and also relative tools that required to development a user friendly database website. 

I like to thanks Boomi Nathan (https://github.com/eboominathan) for his Dependent-Dropdown-in-Codeigniter-3.0.3
(https://github.com/eboominathan/Dependent-Dropdown-in-Codeigniter-3.0.3) that I used my project.
